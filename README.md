# drybeanclassification
*Classify dry beans into one of 7 classes of beans based on 16 features.* <br>
The aim of this project is to automate the classification of dry beans into their respective classes using Machine Learning classification algorithms. <br>
Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation.<br>
<b> Dataset <b> <br>
The given dry bean dataset has summarized images of 13,611 grains of seven different registered dry beans with 16 features. The task of this project is to classify the dry beans into one of the seven classes using suitable classification algorithms.
